•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is a vision of the owner and our client Liam. 
The system design they wanted to create is a web-based user interface. 
The system is meant to help a customer by giving them package options for training to help guide andeducate them on how to pass their local DMV tests.

•	What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did well in creating my use case diagram.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
From the three documents I would choose to revise the system design document to align more with my business requirements. 
To improve it, the document needs to align more as well as the diagrams in the document to align more with the requirements.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user’s needs were implemented to the system design, by giving them an interface that gives them options to create and update profile information, be able to book their scheduling for training, test practices, and local DMV guidance. 

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Designing the software, we need to meet the customers’ ideas, while making it feasible and be able to adapt and change. 
For future systems getting the most information from the customer and their ideas would help when analyzing and designing a system. Since a system needs to meet client requirements.
